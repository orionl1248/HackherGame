General Overview: 
    This is a console log lottery/slots game. It's fun, lighthearted, and has plenty of fun UMass quips that any UMass alumn/student would love. Enjoy some great (hand-designed) graphics, reactive player stats, and goose-based lore while following through our crazy little 24 hack!

Lore: 
    After a 21+ bender in Vegas, you, a UMass student with poor planning skills, find yourself miles from home with $100 to your name. You curse the slots, but they'll be key to helping you return as you hike cross country back to the most magical place on earth, or at least the best dining in America (screw you Disney). 

Gameplay:
    After enjoying some quality starter lore, walk step-by-step back to UMass so you can get home before your health runs out & even UHS can't save you. You can play slot games to earn more money & buy power-ups to try to get home as quickly as possible.
